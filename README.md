# StockWarz

A fun little stock trading simulation game for the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE).

Players can sign up and purchase stocks from the stock market and watch as their stocks go on a bull run...or go bust! Players can also view a leaderboard to see who's got the highest amount of profit from stock trading and the number 1 player gets the satisfaction of seeing their name highlighted ðŸ˜‰

The data used in this game is actually real data from the ZSE which is updated daily, which ensures realism in the fluctuations of the game and makes it a somewhat realistic simulation of what it's like to trade stocks (albeit massively simplified)

The intention of this app was for me and my friends to personally learn more about stock trading and encourage ourselves to try it out and get a feel without risking paying money.
